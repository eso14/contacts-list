and generates a list in which the contacts are added. The contacts will list the name and number, as well as a circle avatar that displays the initials of the contact, much like a phone already does. Lastly, each contact has a floatingactionbutton to the right which displays a favorite icon. This button can be pressed which changes the color of the heart which is considered "favoriting" the contact.

To delete a contact, the user must press down on contact. This app is handy to have as it lists the contacts that a person might need to get in touch with, without the user having to remember each's contacts full name and phone number. A favorite feature also makes it easy in case of an emergency for someone else to use the user's phone and contact a person if needed.
