# Emergency Checklists

*Who is this for?*

The primary audience for this app is the aviation community, particularly those operating small aircraft. It's designed for pilots that already use electronic flight bags (EFBs) who would like quicker access to emergency procedures during flight.

*What does the app do?*

The homepage displays a list of emergency checklists for various aircraft emergencies (Engine Failure, Fire in-Flight, Spin, etc.). It also allows pilots to mark steps as completed during an emergency, something less comfortable with a paper checklist. If the stock checklists do not meet expectations or do not match the aircraft's Operating Handbook, then the user can add their own custom checklists.

*Why is the app useful?*

Since the app can be made just one swipe away from platforms such as ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot, it could save one's life in its efficiency. It also can act as a study tool for those that want to stay fresh on the emergency procedures for their plane.
